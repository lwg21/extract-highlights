The person I am with feels my complete presence, which in turn results in them feeling valued, cared for, and loved. The better my ability to focus, the more profound my interactions with the people I am with. I can be present because I can focus. I can listen better because I can focus better. Each interaction, even if they are brief, is rewarding because I am able to be present in each of the moments that make up that experience.

Willpower, my mental muscle, is what I use to bring awareness back every time it drifts away. I use those biceps to grab hold of that ball of light as it drifts away, and I draw it back to what it was focused on. Viewing willpower as a mental muscle helps us to understand how willpower is used to direct awareness within the mind. Governing and focusing awareness in the mind is the raison d’être of this book.

Individuals who exhibit high levels of willpower have been nurturing this force for many lifetimes.

Willpower is a double-edged sword, best cultivated alongside one’s nature. Without the influence of a refined, conscientious mind and nature, the force of one’s will can be channeled toward negative traits and impact one’s life in a less than desirable way. The fundamental building blocks that make up a refined mind and nature are qualities such as humility, selflessness, empathy, compassion, kindness, patience, and more. The continual cultivation of these qualities is the framework that guides awareness to higher-minded ways of thought, speech, and action. They are the guidelines that steer willpower toward creating an uplifting life.

It’s common to hear the phrase “He’s so stubborn!” cast at highly focused individuals—a classic echolalia of the ignorant who mistake determination for stubbornness. This determination, the single-minded focus born of due reflection, reason, and clarity of purpose, can often be mistaken for stubbornness. They’re easily confused because stubbornness is the determined action of willpower holding awareness in single-minded focus as well, but devoid of reason and governed by the instinctive nature.

In the majority of conversations, most topics are never brought to a natural conclusion before another commences. A conversation can lose its way and drift aimlessly, like a balloon in the sky. Though it may appear inconsequential to bring each topic to closure, most don’t realize that a pattern is being crafted in the subconscious mind, which feeds the notion that the failure to complete things, even things as seemingly small and insignificant as a conversational topic, has little to no detrimental effects on one’s life or mind.

Initially, the mundane tasks that we need to complete for our mere existence, such as doing the dishes and the laundry and tidying up our home, are scoffed at as a waste of time. This way of thinking eventually makes its way into other aspects of life that have more significant consequences. This then shapes one’s nature to enjoy the euphoria of beginning things and to shun the idea of completing them, causing a person to hop from one unfinished task to another. All of this tends toward dampening the will.

It takes willpower to harness awareness and guide it to the natural conclusion of things. The ability to do so empowers the subconscious with the experience that it can complete the tasks or endeavors that it begins. This is powerful. The materialization of an idea is a completion of that idea. As these experiences recur, impressions in the subconscious, small as they may be, build upon one another, and a self-belief that “I can create and manifest” comes to form as a concrete mindset. Confidence ensues and grows in strength as one endeavor after another is completed. Now life becomes an opportunity to create and manifest. Finish what you begin, no matter how small, mundane, or insignificant you may consider a task. Every time you do so, you are developing your willpower, that mental muscle.

There was always a palpable feeling of leaving one dimension and stepping into another when I entered this room. It was here, in the early hours of the morning, that the monks, a little over two dozen of us, gathered most days of the week to meditate together with Gurudeva. Decades of untold inner experiences born of renunciates’ solitary pursuit of the Self had saturated every nook and cranny of this sacred space, creating a sanctuary that exuded an empyrean vibration not of this world.

It was a simple room with a pitched ceiling and walls wrapped in dark wood. The age of it was felt but not seen. A considerable-sized carpet covered most of the tiled floor. Large sliding glass doors lined a big part of the southeast wall, and a fireplace with a chimney, clad in lava rock, made up the rear of the room. Toward the front, a seat slightly above the ground was set up for Gurudeva. The walls on either side of it were each draped with long scrolls that detailed maps of the inner mind, scribed in Shum, a mystical language he had channeled many decades earlier to effectively train his monks in the fine art of meditation and the experience of Self-Realization. I had spent many hours meditating with Gurudeva in this room and was graced with many profound experiences and insights from him.

Every moment is an opportunity. Should we be graced to see it as such, we can leverage these moments, just as we have with concentration, to develop our willpower.

Upon completing a project, take some time to congratulate yourself and celebrate your win by having consciously exercised your will to accomplish a task. Know that the act of doing this will create a positive impression in your subconscious, an impression that you know how to use your will to begin and finish endeavors. As you complete one project after another, this impression gets reinforced, and you are on your way to manifesting a great many things in your life.

For all the ones you want to complete, apply the three methods of developing willpower and complete them. For the ones you choose not to complete, you can come to terms with renouncing them, knowing that you’ve used your wisdom to guide your decision that these projects are no longer worth investing your energy and time in.

Going forward, be very conscious of what you say to someone. Every time you tell someone you are going to do something, use your willpower to do so. Keep in mind that this has nothing to do with proving yourself to others. It has to do with strengthening your will. If every time you say you are going to do something, you don’t, then you are only dampening your will, and creating patterns within the subconscious that do not support the development of your willpower. However, if you always do what you say, then you create patterns that strengthen your will. You should adopt this attitude not only toward others but to yourself as well. If you tell yourself you’re going to do something, then you should go ahead and do it to the best of your ability and a little more. Setting a time frame for when you will get it done can encourage the timely completion of it, lest you procrastinate.

When awareness wanders aimlessly in the conscious mind, a mirroring pattern is created in the subconscious. As you may recall from one of the early lessons in the book, the subconscious mind records what is happening in the conscious mind. As we allow awareness to be distracted from what it is meant to be focused on and be off on yet another saunter in the mind, we reinforce this distracted pattern in the subconscious. Repeat this process over and over again, and we strengthen the pattern in the subconscious.

Awareness being concentrated in the conscious mind re-impresses the subconscious with further patterns of focus. Thus a cycle begins. But this time, instead of a vicious cycle of distraction, a positive cycle of focus is in place. As a result, whenever you are not in charge of your awareness in your conscious mind, your subconscious will take hold of awareness and navigate it in a focused way, guided by the deeply ingrained patterns of concentration that were created by the Wheel of Concentration.

Many assume that the acquisition of knowledge per se means that one is learning and growing. It absolutely does not mean that. It only means you have gathered more information. The application of that knowledge in a timely way is what demonstrates how well a person has grasped that knowledge.

There are other times when I will just lie down and allow my awareness to drift away for a fixed period of time and observe where it goes in my mind. This is always fascinating, as it quite often highlights what is in the forefront of my mind and also what is unresolved in my subconscious. But these periods when I unleash awareness and allow it to roam in my mind are always for a fixed duration. Simply setting a timer for this mental odyssey suffices to ensure that it does not go on endlessly. Remember, we do not want to train awareness to wander aimlessly in the mind, lest it become a dominant pattern.

The goal ultimately is to be in charge of where awareness goes in the mind. But in a controlled environment it is acceptable to let awareness loose. If you took your dog to a dog park, you would feel comfortable unleashing the dog, knowing it was in a controlled space. You wouldn’t do that in an area that is not fenced in, where it might run onto a busy road. Likewise, use your wisdom to decide when to let your awareness off the leash of your willpower.

I do this knowing that my awareness will never be guided to a place that I don’t want it to go to. However, in conversations with strangers, I am much more observant of where my awareness is being taken, and I am always ready to rein awareness back should it be taken to an unwholesome area of the mind.

So I said his name out loud in a firm tone to bring his awareness to attention. Then I looked at him and said, “One of two things needs to happen right now. Either you put the phone away and no longer look at it or we end the meeting and I’ll leave.

So what is observation? One of the definitions of observation found in Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary is “the act of careful watching and listening: the activity of paying close attention to someone or something in order to get information.” My guru would often refer to observation as the “mountaintop perspective.” When you are on top of the mountain, you can be observant of everything down below.

Being observant, you are able to see pitfalls and opportunities in your life. This does not mean you will always avoid those pitfalls and take those opportunities, but the fact that you are observant of them provides you with countless possibilities to make choices that result in better outcomes.

It’s common for people to think that when you are focused you have tunnel vision. It’s true that awareness is locked on one thing, but as you know now, focus gives birth to observation.

Let’s define mindfulness. The Oxford English Dictionary defines mindfulness as “a mental state achieved by concentrating on the present moment.” A careful examination of this definition would reveal that mindfulness is a by-product of concentration: a mental state that results from being focused. Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines mindfulness as “the practice of maintaining a nonjudgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one’s thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.” I am going to abbreviate this definition but still keep the meaning and the words used and say, “The practice of maintaining a state of complete awareness of one’s experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.” (Note that they use the word “awareness” differently than I do.)

From this we can conclude that we don’t practice mindfulness. We don’t practice being observant. Instead, what we do is practice concentration. Mindfulness and observation are states of mind that come as by-products of awareness being trained to be concentrated for prolonged periods of time. In other words, concentration is necessary to experience the state of mindfulness or observation.

Multitasking, like distraction, is the antithesis of focus. To understand multitasking, it’s best that we define it. Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines multitasking as the performance of multiple tasks at one time. The Oxford dictionary defines multitasking in two ways. With regard to a person, it defines it as the ability to “deal with more than one task at the same time”; with regard to a computer it defines it as the ability to “execute more than one program or task simultaneously.”

As awareness travels back and forth repeatedly between two things, it consumes a lot of energy. Awareness has to engage with Item A for a brief period, then disengage from it in order to engage with Item B. Now it is engaged with Item B for a brief moment before needing to disengage with it and reengage with Item A. When it reengages with Item A, awareness must now identify where it left off previously and then reengage itself in that particular area of the thread of conversation or activity again.

People spend much of their lives working to earn an income that will provide them with the opportunity to create experiences for themselves. These experiences can range from having a meal at a hawker stall with friends to cruising on a private yacht and everything in between. Regardless of what the experience is, one thing will determine how much you get out of that experience, and that is your ability to be present in that experience.

When awareness spends a great deal of time absorbed in mental fantasy and daydreaming about the future, disappointment, sadness, and depression may follow. This is because what you are conjuring up in your mind is not what you are manifesting in the physical world. Having a clear mental picture of the future is a very important step in manifesting what you want, but the work to manifest the future needs to be done in the present. That’s where the future is created—in the here and now!

Then there are those who spend the majority of their time in the present, engaged with unwavering focus on whatever it is they are doing. They are the creators. The manifesters. The leaders. The ones who know that all things are created in the here and now, in the eternity of the moment. My guru drove the understanding of “now is the only reality” into every sinew of me.

This roughly twenty-one square feet of Hawaiian real estate was now to be my new home. I had just been instructed to renounce my former massive one-hundred-square-foot bungalow. I replied slowly, “OK. I’ll move into it in the morning.” Twilight was fast setting in, and this was not something I was enthused about doing in a dark forest. Gurudeva responded, “You can do it now.” “But it’s getting dark,” I gently pushed back. “You have a flashlight, don’t you?” And that was the end of that conversation

For one reason or another, we procrastinate. In this case, moving to a forest dwelling made me feel uncomfortable, perhaps even slightly fearful. By getting me to move immediately, Gurudeva intentionally brought my awareness to the present moment, allowing me to face my discomfort and any possible fears. By getting me to do things now and not later, he was also teaching me one of the key ingredients of manifesting things in my life. The future is manifested in the here and now. Not later or tomorrow.

Left to their own devices, they are poisons steadfast in their resolve to permeate every part of our lives, from our mind and body to the lives of those we touch each day, with devastating consequences. They cripple the will and paralyze awareness, slowing life to a grinding halt. But we need not acquiesce to them and live as their slave in mental squalor. There is a panacea to ameliorate such a state of mind and eventually free the mind from the shackles of fear and worry. Mastery of awareness in the mind is the cure, the time-tested elixir to end this tyranny—available to all who seek it, exclusive to none.

Gurudeva turned to me and said, “When you are in the conscious mind, you need to play by the conscious mind rules.” Worry is one of the children of the conscious mind. When awareness is in the conscious mind, the instinctive mind, you expose it to the experience of worry. If you spend much of your time in the conscious mind, it behooves you to be cognizant that the experience of worry is a possibility. The level of your mastery over awareness in the mind determines how much you subject yourself to worry.

Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines worry as “mental distress or agitation resulting from concern usually for something impending or anticipated.” The Cambridge dictionary gives a definition that is perhaps a little easier to digest: “to think about problems or unpleasant things that might happen in a way that makes you feel unhappy and frightened.”

What you’ve learned in this book so far is a systematic approach to overcoming worry. First understand that awareness and the mind are two distinctly separate things. Then know that awareness moves and the mind does not. Realize that willpower and concentration can be developed to harness and direct awareness within the mind. Now, if awareness goes into the future to create worrisome situations in your mind, use your willpower to rein it back to the present and use your powers of concentration to hold it in the present. This is the key to eliminating worry from your life.

You consult experts and find the best solutions to ensure that if such an event were to occur, you have the best solutions in place. So, even though you allowed awareness to go into the future and create a problematic situation, you never allowed it to create distress in your mind. You achieved this by finding a solution to your problem. This is very different from awareness going back and forth into the future, reexperiencing the problem without actually solving it.

The past, on the other hand, is not where worry lives. You can’t worry about anything that has happened in the past because it has already happened. There is absolutely nothing that you can do about it. But what you can worry about is the consequences of your past actions that may manifest in the future.

Worry is awareness going into the future, creating a problem in our mind that has not happened, then returning to the present and being distressed about that problem. Now, if awareness were to repeatedly visit that exact problem in the mind (which essentially is the act of worry), then it would be strengthening that problem each time it visits it. This is because every time awareness goes to it, that is where energy is flowing, and that problem in the mind is being strengthened.

Now, if you allow awareness to repeatedly visit that problem in the form of worry, repeatedly depositing energy into it, you are strengthening this problem in your mind. The more energy that is deposited into this pattern in your mind—the worry—the stronger it becomes. As this process repeats itself consistently over time, we begin to materialize that worry on the physical plane.

Firstly, what plays out in the mind in fear is no different than in worry. Fear, like worry, is future based. You can’t fear the past. The past has happened, and there is nothing that can be done about it—though we can fear the repercussions of our past actions that may manifest in the future. At the core of the eternity of the moment, you are pure energy that cannot be created or destroyed. Fear does not and cannot exist here. In the eternity of the moment, you are always “all right, right now.” The only place fear lives is in the future.

The fear state of mind has no capability to make rational decisions. In Hindu metaphysics, which I was trained in and which this book is based on, if you were to look at the mind as a multistory building where each floor is a state of mind, you would see that reason resides two floors above fear. If you are on the fear level of the mind, you would have no capacity to reason, and if you were totally immersed on the reason level of your mind, you would simply reason yourself out of fear. If you were living in a multistory apartment building and someone was living two floors above you, you would not be able to communicate with them without the assistance of some device. What they experience on that floor would also be different from what you experience on yours. Your perspectives would also differ.

Fear is not always a bad thing. We live in a physical body, and that body is tied to our instinctive mind. That is the animal nature of us, and it can sense an actual threat or danger, which then brings about a sense of fear in us. So at times, the fear we experience is a self-protective mechanism. If we heed this sign, we can use it to avoid a harmful experience. But if we allow that fear to grow and dominate our awareness, that is when things start going to hell in a handbasket.

By and large, the Canadiens were small-scale, largely self-sufficient peasant farmers whose lives were framed by a system of rights and obligations inherent in the seigneurial system, a feudal system of land tenure unique in colonial North America. The Crown granted large tracts of land to individual seigneurs, or lords, who in turn sub-granted it to individual farmers, or habitants. Stretching away from the St Lawrence River and its tributaries, and backing on to the forest, were long, thin, and rectangular lots that gave each farmer access to fresh water, transportation, and a small woodlot. In return for the right to farm the land, to leave it to his heirs, and even to sell it, the farmer was obligated to pay the seigneur a cens, an annual token payment, and a rente, a more significant payment in either kind or cash. But the seigneur also had obligations, including the provision of a gristmill and sometimes a court of law to settle minor disputes. And unlike British landlords, he could not evict his tenants and he had to use the courts to collect outstanding payments. In addition to the cens and the rentes there was the tithe, a payment to the curé, or parish priest, set at one-twenty-sixth of the grain harvest.

At least initially, the seigneurial system had obvious advantages because speculators could not hoard land and because families did not need a large down payment to establish a farm. Over time, however, a different picture emerged: a significant portion of the agricultural surplus was given to priests and landlords, making them in effect a local aristocracy and retarding economic development.

If New France was primarily French and Catholic, it wasn’t only French and Catholic. There were important Haudenosaunee communities at Kahnawaké and Kanesataké near Montreal and a Wendat community at Wendaké near Quebec. There were a small number of Protestants. And there were slaves, both Indigenous (mostly Pawnee) and African.

According to one estimate, there were 2,000 slaves in New France from 1700 to 1760, including Marie-Joseph Angélique, a Portuguese-born African slave, who worked as a domestic servant in Montreal. When her mistress threatened to sell her to the West Indies in 1734, she set fire to her home, a common form of slave resistance, but the wind carried the embers and soon much of lower Montreal was in flames. Poet Afua Cooper imagines Angélique, who was tortured and executed, telling her confessor to ‘write down my story so it can be known in history’. Indeed, Angélique is an important and compelling reminder that New France was not only white but also black. And where yesterday’s historians referred to the homogeneity of New France, today’s historians understand that it was a multicultural society.

France and Britain were powerful empires and therefore powerful rivals on both sides of the Atlantic. The War of the Grand Alliance, the War of Spanish Succession, and the War of Austrian Succession meant that New France knew war, preparation for war, and rumours of war. Officially the Seven Years War began in 1756, but unofficially it began in 1754 when the French, British, and Haudenosaunee confronted each other in the Ohio Valley, making it a nine-year war in North America. The stakes were huge: for the French and British, it was control over much of the continent; for the Canadiens, it was control over the St Lawrence Valley; for Indigenous peoples, primarily allies of the French but also allies of the British, it was control over their territory; and for the Acadians, once Britain began the deportation of 10,000 men, women, and children from their farms and villages in 1755, it was pure survival.

In 1759 Britain defeated France on a farmer’s field less than 1,000 metres outside the walls of Quebec. France capitulated the following spring and, three years later, formally ceded New France, ‘quelques arpents de neige’, sniffed the French philosopher Voltaire. But to the people who lived there and who had never read French Enlightenment philosophy, New France wasn’t a few acres of snow. It was home.

The Battle of the Plains of Abraham lasted just a few minutes but the Battle of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, fought by historians, journalists, and politicians, has lasted over 250 years. To French Canadian historians, the Conquest was a short- and long-term tragedy that forestalled the normal development of New France from colony to nation, rendering it a colony interrupted. In the 1960s and 1970s, Quebec separatists insisted that only Quebec’s independence could correct the course of history. To English Canadian historians, however, the Conquest didn’t alter the basic logic of Canadian history: the development of a transcontinental commercial empire based on a series of staples, or commodities, first fish, then fur, and later timber, wheat, and minerals. If anything, the Conquest had tied Canada to Great Britain, a much stronger commercial and maritime power. Maybe. Maybe not.

In any event, Britain could not do in Canada in 1763 what it had done in Acadia in 1755, meaning it would have to find ways to integrate a large, French-speaking, and Roman Catholic population. The Canadiens too had to find ways to live in a new and alien empire. Conflict was inevitable, but accommodation, adaptation, and adjustment shaped, and continues to shape, the relationship between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians. A defining fact of Canadian politics from the 18th century to the present, it has been called the Canadian Fact: French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians have to coexist.

But what did the Seven Years War and the final defeat of France in North America mean for Indigenous peoples? In a word, disaster. ‘Although you have conquered the French, you have not conquered us,’ an Ojibwa chief told the British when he insisted that he wouldn’t give up his forests, lakes, and mountains. But that is precisely what happened. No longer able to play one empire off against the other, Indigenous peoples found themselves politically marginalized and, despite British promises, unable to defend their territory over the long term.

Following the defeat of New France, Great Britain remade northern North America, through force when necessary, but primarily through immigration, settlement, capital, science, and the law. At the conclusion of the American Revolution in 1783, 60,000 Loyalists sought new homes and new lives in British North America. Loyal to Great Britain, persecuted in the United States, persuaded by the promise of free land, and assisted by the Crown, they settled in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Upper Canada (Ontario). In effect, they were the first political refugees in modern history. Some Loyalists were wealthy, but most weren’t; some were political, military, and religious elites, but the vast majority were farmers and labourers; some were English, but others were Irish, Scottish, German, and French; some were Protestant, but others were Catholic and even Mennonite; some were Indigenous, allies of the British during the Revolutionary War; and some were black, both slave and free.

However, Nova Scotia wasn’t the hoped-for promised land and in 1792 nearly one-third of the black loyalists left for Sierra Leone in West Africa. And if Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island were not slave societies like Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, they were societies with slaves: according to one estimate, between 1,500 and 2,000 slaves came with their Loyalist owners to the Maritimes. Slavery in the Maritimes, at least until the early 1820s, was enforced by violence and upheld by the law.

The peopling of Canada continued between 1815 and 1850 when close to one million people crossed the Atlantic as part of the much larger Anglo-Celtic diaspora to Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and British North America. They came from England, Wales, and Scotland, although a majority came from Ireland. In the main, they were Protestant, but a sizeable minority were Catholic. They settled in Newfoundland, transforming it into a settlement colony after nearly 300 years as a seasonal fishery; they found work in the forests of New Brunswick, turning it into a timber colony supplying Great Britain’s insatiable demand for wood; and they tried their luck in Quebec, building the Lachine Canal in the 1820s and taking work in Montreal’s emerging industrial economy. But most immigrants travelled west to Upper Canada where land could be acquired and where, in the words of an 1832 emigrant guidebook, a man could be ‘the lord and master of his own estate’. Indeed, the notion that land could be measured, parcelled, bought, and sold—and the related promise by the colonial state to uphold property rights—underwrote the great land rush. By mid-century Upper Canada had a population of 950,000. Now Ontario, it is still Canada’s most populous province.

Great Britain united Upper and Lower Canada into a quasi-federal union in 1841, the United Province of Canada, with two sections, Canada East and Canada West. But a vigorous policy of assimilation was never pursued. Today, 23 per cent of Canadians speak French at home. In Quebec that figure is close to 87 per cent.

British North America was at a crossroads in the 1860s: it could continue to exist as a string of colonies stretching from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island or it could form a federal union. Having been floated since at least 1839, Confederation was not a new idea, although it never gained momentum, the distances between the colonies being too great. But as railways, telegraphs, and printing presses shrank those distances, the idea of a transcontinental nation became increasingly attractive and viable. Meanwhile, the Northwest—an enormous agricultural frontier representing the promise of Eden—inspired visions of destiny and predictions of settlement. Still, Confederation was by no means unanimous: negotiations were difficult; opponents were determined; and questions of identity were debated, sometimes bitterly. But in 1867 the British North America Act constituted the Dominion of Canada.

Although the metaphor of marriage is sometimes used to describe Canada in 1867, divorce is also a useful metaphor. Driving Confederation was political deadlock in the United Province of Canada and the need for its constituent parts to separate one from the other and to become Ontario and Quebec. Union, said a leading French Canadian politician in 1865, was a separation that would allow Quebec to preserve its autonomy and its institutions, especially its church and its language. But if reconstituted along new federal lines, the Canadian Fact—the fact of coexistence between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians—was still a fact.

In time, more provinces entered Confederation: Manitoba joined in 1870; British Columbia in 1871 with the promise of a transcontinental railway; and Prince Edward Island in 1873 with the promise of better terms, including financial assistance and year-round communications with the mainland. In 1905 Alberta and Saskatchewan entered as new provinces carved out of the old Northwest. For its part, Newfoundland deferred the question to an election in 1869:

At the federal level, the principle of representation by population was conceded in the lower house, the House of Commons, meaning Ontario and Quebec would have more members of Parliament than New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. However, the principle of representation by region governed the upper house, the Senate, making it, in theory, a house of the regions, an institution in which the smaller, less populated regions would not be overwhelmed by the larger, more populated regions.

In the Northwest, a different and more tragic discontent was slowly burning: just a few months earlier, in January 1867, an official with the Hudson’s Bay Company at Fort Edmonton reported that the buffalo were disappearing (Figure 1). Ten years later they were effectively gone and the Plains Indigenous peoples were making the difficult transition to reserves.

Speaking to the House of Commons in 1883, Sir John A. Macdonald confessed that he wasn’t sorry that the buffalo had disappeared because, as long as there was hope that the herds would return, it would be difficult to compel the Plains Indigenous peoples to settle on reserves. Describing the Northwest as Canada’s inheritance, Canada’s first prime minister added that future generations expected nothing less than bold patriotism from this generation. Of course, what Macdonald saw as Canada’s trust fund belonged to someone else, a fact that required the federal government to negotiate a series of treaties with the land’s original owners.

Negotiating and signing treaties had been the basis of Britain’s Indian policy since the late 18th century when the Royal Proclamation of 1763—sometimes called the Indian Magna Carta or the Indian Bill of Rights—obligated the Crown to protect Indigenous peoples from land-hungry and often unprincipled settlers. But in the late 19th century there was a new urgency: the west had to be settled before the Americans could acquire it. Between 1871 and 1877 Canada negotiated a series of treaties in the Northwest—called the numbered treaties—with the Cree, the Ojibwa, the Assiniboine, and the Blackfoot, among others.

A way of life thousands of years old had collapsed. Still, Indigenous peoples saw themselves as equals and the treaties as land sharing agreements. Land was not something that could be ceded. But to treaty negotiators, land could be ceded and the treaties were land surrender agreements. In the words of Treaty Six, the Indians ‘do hereby cede, release, surrender, and yield up’ forever ‘their rights, titles, and privileges’ to their former lands in return for reserve lands, farm implements, livestock, schools, and cash annuities. The tragedy of history lies not in the treaties themselves but in Canada’s failure—and sometimes its refusal—to fulfil its end of the treaties: reserve lands tended to be marginal; farm implements and agricultural instruction were not forthcoming; food rations were parsimonious and, on occasion, withheld; and some government officials, tasked with administering the treaties and overseeing Canada’s Indian policy, traded food for sex, in effect forcing Indigenous women into prostitution.

Descendants of Scottish and French traders and their Indigenous wives, the Metis had carved out a place in the plains economy, in the buffalo hunt, and in provisioning the fur trade. But they were rightly worried about settlement. When the Canadian government sent surveyors to Red River (Winnipeg) in 1869 to redraw the region into townships, sections, and lots, the Metis saw their future: dispossession by lines on a map not of their making.

Forcing the government’s hand, Riel and the Metis negotiated Manitoba’s entry into Confederation in 1870. Tragically, the land rights they had negotiated proved illusory. Overwhelmed by settlers and land speculators, the Metis moved west, to the South Saskatchewan River Valley, where they developed a system of land tenure based on customary, or Aboriginal, title. Unlike the Indigenous peoples, however, they didn’t have treaties and were therefore vulnerable.

Although the Metis had hoped the Cree would join them, very few did. Despite their real grievances, they held to their treaty promises to maintain peace and order. The government responded quickly, crushing the Northwest Rebellion, or resistance as Indigenous people call it, and arresting everyone connected to it, including Big Bear and Poundmaker, two Cree chiefs who had struggled to prevent violence, and One Arrow, also a Cree chief whose participation had been tangential at most. At his trial for treason-felony—which was conducted in English with imperfect translation into Cree, there being no Cree words for traitor, rebellion, or Crown—One Arrow listened to the charges against him: ‘knocking off the Queen’s hat and stabbing her in the behind’. A confused One Arrow asked the interpreter, ‘Are you drunk?’ Big Bear, Poundmaker, and One Arrow received three-year jail sentences. Others weren’t so lucky: charged with murder, eight Cree and Assiniboine warriors were sentenced to death and executed in a mass hanging before a crowd that had been deliberately assembled from nearby reserves to witness the power and majesty of the law and what can happen when one steps out of line.

In 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an official apology to Indigenous peoples for Canada’s role in residential schools; compensation totalling $1.6 billion was paid to nearly 80,000 former students; and, with a mandate to investigate and acknowledge what happened to Indigenous children, families, and communities, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission travelled the length and breadth of the country, gathering the stories of former students. In 2015 it released its much-anticipated report: residential schools were part of a larger policy of cultural genocide. Residential schools date to New France, although they were tiny and largely a failure: Indigenous peoples did not want to be separated from their children nor did they wish to become French. Indeed, it was not until the 19th century that residential schools took root, first in Upper Canada and, after Confederation, across much of the country, including the far north. Paid for by the federal government and run by the churches, residential schools were, according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, ‘lonely and alien’ places staffed by poorly trained and, in some instances, predatory teachers and administrators. The last residential schools closed in the late 1990s. Describing the system of residential schools as a painful story of destruction in the name of civilization, the Commission also acknowledged that it is a complicated story because some Aboriginal peoples benefited.

The goal of St Therese Residential School was the goal of every residential school: assimilation. Indigenous languages were banned, as were Indigenous religious and cultural practices. Catholicism was preached, though rarely practised, according to Merasty: ‘Oh, God, I used to think, what hypocrisy.’ Although some teachers and staff were kind, others enjoyed inflicting pain, including a sadistic nun and one priest in particular. Violence wasn’t exceptional, it was structural: a strap across the hand, a slap across the face, and a smack across the backside, for speaking Cree, for not paying attention, and for failing to form a straight line. The violence was sexual too, pederasts using force and coercion and buying silence with candy or the threat of more force.

It instituted Indian bands, defined as a body of Indians, that allowed the federal government to impose a new governance structure of elected band chiefs and elected band councils in an effort to end, or at least bypass, traditional governance models of hereditary chiefs and consensus decision making;

The government yet again amended the Indian Act in 1927, this time in response to the formation of the Allied Tribes of British Columbia and its assertion of Aboriginal title: in effect, it now became an offence to hire lawyers for the prosecution of land claims. Ostensibly, the government wanted to protect Indigenous peoples from unscrupulous lawyers. In reality, it didn’t want to confront in court the complicated question of Aboriginal title in British Columbia where there were no treaties.

In 1969 the government of Pierre Trudeau released its Statement on Indian Policy, better known as the White Paper: to be an Indian, it argued, was to be apart in law and in the provision of government services. It therefore proposed repealing the Indian Act and shutting down the Department of Indian Affairs. Demonstrating a narrow and incorrect understanding of treaties as simple contracts made obsolete by the modern world, Trudeau actually proposed ending them once the appropriate amounts of twine and gunpowder had been paid. Only sameness of treatment, he insisted, would bring Indigenous peoples into the mainstream of Canadian life, with all of its opportunities and responsibilities. Although the White Paper used the language of diversity, dignity, and citizenship, it effectively restated Duncan Campbell Scott’s objective. Of course, Indigenous peoples had no love for the Indian Act and had been successful in pressing change. Eighteen years earlier, in 1951, the federal government responded to their demands when it passed an amendment allowing women to vote in band elections and when it removed bans on the potlatch, the wearing of Aboriginal costumes in stampedes and pageants, and the hiring of lawyers to launch land claims. But Indigenous peoples also understood that, for all its faults, the Indian Act conferred legal status and, ironically, stood between them and assimilation.

Caught in a web of legal coercion, in a country that saw them as a problem that it now wanted to solve by repealing the Indian Act, Indigenous peoples fought back: they weren’t the problem, Canada was.

The federal government quickly shelved the White Paper, but it couldn’t shelve Indigenous peoples: with renewed energy, a new generation of Indigenous leaders and activists would solve the Canadian problem in the courts, at the table, and, on occasion, in the streets. From one end of the country to the other, comprehensive land claims were launched; resource deals were negotiated; commissions of inquiry were appointed; historical wrongs were acknowledged; compensation packages were agreed to; and legal decisions were handed down. Using the law—expressed in contemporary human rights and embodied in historical proclamations, treaties, and promises—Indigenous peoples advanced the cause of self-government and the building of nation-to-nation relationships. It has not been painless and there have been missteps, but the arc of history is bending towards reconciliation.

If land was a key part of the Indigenous struggle, it was not the only part: pressing their own claims, women who had seen their status taken away now wanted it back. As wives, mothers, and daughters, Indigenous women had played leading roles in Canadian history. In fact, the fur trade depended on their labour: in addition to acting as important go-betweens, or diplomats, between the fur traders and Indigenous peoples, they cooked, cleaned, had children, sewed moccasins, made snowshoes, and prepared pemmican, a mixture of dried meat and animal grease. Not only could pemmican be carried over long distances, as a source of protein and fat, it made those distances possible. Beginning in the late 19th century, Indigenous women entered the labour market, sometimes seasonally, for example in the salmon canneries in British Columbia, but often permanently as well, as domestic servants, hairdressers, nurses, and public health educators.

The economic, social, and health indicators for today’s 1.7 million Indigenous people paint a depressing picture. Unemployment rates are roughly double the Canadian average; the poverty rate for children living on reserves is 60 per cent; and for children living off reserves it is over 50 per cent. Food, water, and housing insecurity are all greater for Indigenous people than non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women and girls are five-and-a-half times more likely to be murdered than non-Indigenous women and girls. Incarceration rates for both Indigenous men and women in provincial and federal prisons are utterly disproportionate: Indigenous people make up 5 per cent of Canada’s population but 25 per cent of its federal corrections population, leading one observer to call prisons the new residential schools. A 2014 study concluded that half of the victims of sex trafficking in Canada are Indigenous women and girls. Finally, Indigenous people are more likely than non-Indigenous people to be obese, have chronic health conditions, and be living with HIV/AIDS. Together, these indicators add up to another heartbreaking reality: the suicide rate for Indigenous people is double that of the general population. For Inuit people living in the far north it is eleven times higher.

Is Canada one nation? Or two nations? Or even three? Well, it’s complicated. In law, it is one nation and only Ottawa can speak for Canada. But in fact, it is three nations: English Canada, Quebec, and First Nations. Complicating things, Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion before it joined Confederation in 1949, meaning it too has a national memory and identity. As a result, nationalism has been a recurring theme in 20th-century Canada.

Britishness was not imposed top down from the outside, but came bottom up from the inside, from politicians, journalists, writers, and citizens who, in the last decades of the 19th century and across the first half of the 20th century, celebrated Canada’s British past and sang its British destiny. To this end, Queen Victoria was placed on a pedestal, literally and figuratively, from one end of the country to the other, from Victoria, British Columbia to Victoria Junction, Cape Breton. United by a common allegiance to a shared crown, the British Empire imparted a sense of power and linked Canada to a noble mission, or what it believed was a noble mission. But Quebec never got misty-eyed for Queen Victoria or her heirs and successors. Nor did it share English Canada’s devotion to the Empire and its mission. It had its own national identity as a French and Catholic nation.

When Great Britain went to war in South Africa in 1899, Wilfrid Laurier, Canada’s first French Canadian prime minister, had to navigate Canada’s different nationalisms. Energized by the enthusiasm of a jingoistic press, English Canada wanted to paint the map red, a reference to world maps that showed the British Empire in red and which hung in every school in the country. But French Canada did not see the South African War as its war and, if anything, sympathized with the Afrikaner republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State against the British Empire. Searching for a compromise, Laurier sent volunteers only to South Africa.

Navigating Canada’s different nationalisms was infinitely harder when a far greater crisis consumed much of the world in August 1914. William Black Creighton, editor of the Christian Guardian, was emphatic: ‘We are British!’ But Henri Bourassa, editor of Le Devoir, asked a tough question: although we refer to ‘our Empire’, have you ‘ever considered how little we Canadians count in that Empire’? The street sweeper in Liverpool and the cab driver in London have more say in the running of the Empire, he said, than seven million Canadians because that street sweeper and that cab driver can vote in British elections. English Canada called him a traitor, but Quebec called him a nationalist.

Neither Creighton nor Bourassa could have predicted the enormity of the First World War: 620,000 Canadians enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force; 450,000 went overseas; 61,000 were killed; 172,000 were wounded; and 9,000 returned with what was then called shell shock but what is now understood to have been post-traumatic stress. On the home front and in field hospitals were 3,100 Canadian nurses, nicknamed the bluebirds because of their distinctive blue and white uniforms.

According to conventional wisdom, Canada came of age in the First World War. And like all conventional wisdom, it contains an element of truth. Even before the war ended, Prime Minister Robert Borden had begun to draw on the language of independence and sovereignty when referring to Canada and the Empire. Still, it is not the only truth because the Canada that emerged from the war was also badly divided, English Canada on the one hand and Quebec on the other. The main wedge? Conscription, or compulsory overseas military service.

When Borden won the election, the Quebec Legislative Assembly debated, but did not pass, a 1918 motion calling for Quebec’s secession from Canada. A few months later, in April 1918, anti-conscription riots in Quebec City left four people dead, 150 people wounded, and a police station burned to the ground. In a show of authority, the federal government responded quickly when it declared martial law, suspended habeas corpus, and imposed a curfew in Quebec City. Although very few conscripts made it to the front, the conscription crisis strained national politics, deepened the divide between Canada’s two solitudes, English Canada and French Canada, and tilled the soil for an independence movement to take root.

Newfoundland too went to war when 5,500 men joined up, most in the Newfoundland Regiment. But in less than thirty minutes on the morning of 1 July 1916 at the Battle of Beaumont-Hamel, which was part of the larger Battle of the Somme, much of the regiment was wiped out by German machine guns, or mowed down like sheep according to one of the few survivors. Not a single metre of ground had been gained. Since 1917 Newfoundland has marked 1 July as Memorial Day and many Newfoundlanders wear a small bouquet of forget-me-nots in the same way that many Canadians wear a poppy on 11 November. Indeed, Beaumont-Hamel occupies a sombre place in Newfoundland’s cultural and national memory. Moreover, the combined effects of the First World War, especially the terrible burden of debt, contributed to Newfoundland’s bankruptcy in the 1930s and its narrow decision to join Canada in 1949. But 1 July is Canada Day, making it a bifurcated holiday in Newfoundland: in the morning, a service is held at the National War Memorial in St John’s, the provincial capital; in the evening, fireworks bring the day to an end. The dual meaning of 1 July in Newfoundland makes it a province with a national memory.

Like the First World War, the Second World War tested Canada’s national fault lines. Although autonomous in foreign affairs, there was never any doubt that Canada, as a British country and as a member of the British Commonwealth, would declare war against Germany in September 1939. Mobilizing 1.1 million men and women, it sent troops to Hong Kong, Italy, France, and Holland while German U-boats patrolled the Gulf of the St Lawrence, advancing to within 300 kilometres of Quebec City. It played a key role in the Battle of the Atlantic, keeping open the shipping lanes between North America and Great Britain. It managed the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, training 130,000 crewmen and women. And it landed at Normandy on D-Day, liberating the Netherlands and, with the Allies, pressing into Germany where the 21st Army Group liberated the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp in April 1945. When the war ended, 43,000 Canadians had been killed and another 55,000 had been injured, but Nazi Germany had been defeated. Seventy-five years later, Holland still sends Canada thousands of tulip bulbs every year to say thank you.

Technically, the Quiet Revolution was a series of political and economic reforms implemented by the Quebec government between 1960 and 1966 that remade the province into a modern, bureaucratic, and secular state in the fields of education, health, and social welfare. But the Quiet Revolution was more than a series of political reforms because it also remade French Canadian nationalism into Quebec nationalism, a process that began after the Second World War and lasted into the 1970s. No longer defensive and Catholic, it was now assertive and separatist. Ensuring Quebec’s survival—an imperative that stretched back to 1759, the Plains of Abraham, and the Conquest—meant achieving Quebec’s independence. In this sense, the Quiet Revolution was not particularly quiet. At the same time, English Canada experienced its own quiet revolution, sometimes called the Other Quiet Revolution, when it replaced its definition of Canada as British with a new definition of Canada as bilingual and multicultural where belonging would be premised not on ethnicity and being of the tribe but on equality and citizenship. Together, the Quiet and Other Quiet Revolutions remade Canada, making the 1960s and 1970s a period of excitement, experiment, and ferment, of impatience and even violence. Managing Canada’s different nationalisms would not be easy when everything was on the table and open to reinvention, including the flag, the key symbol of any country.

In 1964 Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced that Canada would have a new flag in time for its centennial in 1967, one that was distinctly Canadian. The old flag, the Red Ensign, had a Union Jack in the upper left quarter and, as a result, could never speak to French Canadians.

In the end, the committee selected a red maple leaf on a white field. Although the maple leaf had been used as a symbol of Canada since the mid-19th century and although it had appeared on the uniforms of Canadian athletes competing at international events since the early 1900s, many English Canadians resented the new flag. Describing its red and white design as a nosebleed, they called it a sop to the French. It wasn’t, but it was part of the de-ethnicization of English Canada and it marked a key moment in the Other Quiet Revolution.

The pace and direction of change was breathtaking. New writers came into their own, including Leonard Cohen, Mordecai Richler, Margaret Laurence, Alice Munro, and Michael Ondaatje. In 1966 Margaret Atwood published The Circle Game, her first major book of poetry. Exploring the universal and the particular, from freedom to snowshoes, it brought a tough and incisive voice to the ongoing conversation about Canada and the meaning of Canada. It also introduced a brilliant writer to the world. Suddenly Canada was interesting. Just a few years earlier, in 1960, writer Hugh MacLennan had explained what Canadian books meant to American readers: ‘Boy meets girl in Winnipeg and who cares?’ Now a lot of people cared because Canadian writers, aided by Canadian publishers, had interesting things to say about diversity, identity, sexuality, and the accommodation of difference, surely one of the greatest challenges confronting western democracies in the second half of the 20th century. Canadian literature, or CanLit, had become a national and recognizable literature, like American literature or British literature, with its own literary giants, key texts, and recurring themes.

In Vancouver, 100 girls dressed as candles to form a living birthday cake. In Ottawa, a national prayer service acknowledged Canada’s religious pluralism. In Toronto, a young man tossed a hammer through the window of the American Consulate, an expression of rebellious youth and a reminder that English Canada, at least, defined itself against the United States, at that moment escalating its war against Vietnam. Still in Toronto, West Indian Canadians organized the city’s first Caribana, a celebration of West Indian culture and music and a reminder that Canada wasn’t a white country.

What Lalonde and Julien expressed in words and music, the Front de libération du Québec expressed in violence. Inspired by Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Algeria’s National Liberation Front, consumed by the prospect of Quebec’s independence, and intoxicated by romantic notions of violence, the FLQ never enjoyed popular support, although its violence captured headlines across Canada and around the world. Between 1963 and 1970 it placed over 200 bombs at largely symbolic targets, destroying a statue of Queen Victoria in Quebec City, for example, and injuring twenty-seven people in a much larger explosion at the Montreal Stock Exchange. In October 1970 the FLQ plunged the country into chaos when it kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat and therefore a representative of, in its words, an ancient, racist, and imperial government. To buy time, Ottawa met one of the kidnappers’ demands, permitting the FLQ manifesto to be read on Radio-Canada, the public broadcaster. A mashup of anti-capitalism, anti-Catholicism, and revolutionary cant peppered with historical and contemporary grievances, it called for Quebec’s total independence. Next, the FLQ kidnapped Pierre Laporte, a Quebec provincial cabinet minister and, according to the FLQ, a member of the collaborating class.

When asked how far he would go to resolve the crisis, Prime Minister Trudeau responded, ‘Just watch me.’ Three days later, Canadians watched the federal government invoke the War Measures Act, suspend civil liberties, impose curfews, and send the army into Quebec in an overwhelming display of force. The police conducted some 3,000 searches and detained 497 people without charge, including Pauline Julien. On her release eight days later, a defiant Julien told reporters that prison hadn’t been all bad, that she had done calisthenics and got back into shape. To his supporters, then and now, Trudeau had fought fire with fire. To his critics, again, then and now, he had used a sledgehammer on a fly. Two months later, Cross was freed, but Laporte had been murdered, his body stuffed into the trunk of a car. The immediate crisis was over and the FLQ had been extinguished, although the dream of an independent Quebec was still very much alive in the Parti Québécois, a political party committed to achieving Quebec’s independence at the ballot box.

The Quebec question may have dominated the 1960s and 1970s, but it wasn’t the only question: where do we fit in a bicultural Canada, asked Canadians whose ethnic and racial roots were neither French nor British? Demographically, Canada had never been a bicultural country, a point heard over and over again by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. Beginning in the late 1890s, immigration was encouraged not only from Great Britain, but from Eastern and Central Europe, Scandinavia, and Italy: between 1901 and 1931 over three million immigrants arrived in Canada. Most settled on the prairies, taking up the offer of free land in what Canadian immigration agents described as the Last Best West.

A better model, they told the Royal Commission, would be multiculturalism. Japanese Canadians agreed, but, speaking from historical experience, they emphasized racial equality and the need to end racial discrimination. After all, 22,000 Japanese Canadians had been interned in 1942, their property confiscated and sold at fire sale prices. In its report, the Commission acknowledged that no one had suffered more because of the war than Japanese Canadians, even noting the inadequate compensation for their lost property.

Embracing the language of decolonization and nationalism, Indigenous peoples now referred to themselves as First Nations. When the Dene issued its 1975 Declaration of Dene Nationhood, declaring its independence and insisting on its recognition as a nation, they understood that the word nation retains more authority and commands more respect than the word band. For its part, the National Indian Brotherhood—which became the Assembly of First Nations in 1982—now talked about the inherent rights of self-determination and self-government. But what did self-determination and self-government mean? There was never a single answer. But one thing was clear: Indigenous peoples intended to negotiate with the federal government on a nation-to-nation basis, making constitutional negotiations more complicated.

In the wake of the referendum, Trudeau launched a process to patriate, or bring home, Canada’s constitution from Great Britain with an amending formula and a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A colonial hangover that made no sense in the 20th century, only Great Britain, a foreign country, could amend Canada’s constitution. Although there had been attempts in the past to patriate the constitution, Ottawa and the provinces could not agree on an amending formula, on how, exactly, the constitution should be amended. For example, should Quebec, as the only province with a French-speaking majority, have a veto over future amendments? For that matter, should Ontario, as the largest and richest province, have a veto? The debates were legal and technical, but they were also rooted in competing conceptions of Canada: was it ten provinces or two nations?

Earnest speeches, protracted meetings, and difficult court challenges consumed the national agenda for the next eighteen months, but in November 1981 Trudeau realized what has been called his magnificent obsession when he won agreement from nine of ten provinces to a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, entrenched in the constitution and therefore beyond the reach of governments. It was the reason he had entered politics in the 1960s. He also secured an amending formula that did not give Quebec a veto but instead respected the equality of the provinces. Quebec refused to sign the new constitution. Instead, Lévesque referred to the night a deal was reached between Ottawa and the other provinces as la nuit des longs couteaux, as the night of the long knives when Quebec had been stabbed in the back and left to lick its constitutional wounds. Others remember the negotiations differently and correctly: Lévesque had played his cards poorly and lost. But if the night of the long knives was bad history, it was powerful mythology: Quebec had been humiliated. Lévesque told journalists that the consequences would be incalculable, but no one in English Canada was listening. Most polls indicated that English Canadians welcomed a Charter that included French-language rights, Aboriginal rights, women’s rights, and a statement of Canada’s multicultural heritage.

On an overcast afternoon in April 1982, Pierre Trudeau and Queen Elizabeth II signed the new Canadian constitution into law in a ceremony on Parliament Hill. For the most part, people cheered, although there were one or two audible boos. And more than one journalist commented on the wind and rain, blowing, symbolically it seemed, from the Quebec side of the Ottawa River. After all, Quebec nationalism had not gone away. Nor had the demand for self-government by Indigenous peoples been met. In other words, Canada’s constitutional question remained unanswered.

The next front in what was now a decades-long war to constitutionalize and to reconcile Canada’s different nationalisms took place over three years, from 1987 to 1990. By any definition, the Meech Lake Accord was a divisive, even traumatic, moment in Canadian politics. Negotiated behind closed doors, between the prime minister and the ten premiers, in a government conference centre at Meech Lake near Ottawa, the Accord was an attempt to accommodate Quebec nationalism and to secure Quebec’s signature to the constitution. Of course, Quebec was legally inside the constitution, but it was symbolically outside the constitution, making its signature the final step in the process of constitutional renewal that had been started in the 1960s. The Meech Lake Accord, or Meech Lake, or simply Meech, proposed several changes to the Canadian constitution—from the federal spending power and the amending formula to the appointment processes for senators and Supreme Court judges—but its most controversial proposal was the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. It was a variation on an old theme: because Quebec is not a province like the others, it should not be treated like the other provinces. But no one could agree on what, precisely, distinct society meant. Sociologically and historically, Quebec was (and is) distinct. It was (and is) even a nation: renamed in 1968, the provincial assembly is the Assemblée nationale; the provincial flag, the blue and white fleurdelisé, is considered Quebec’s national flag; and the provincial capital, Quebec City, is officially the capitale nationale du Québec. But legally and constitutionally Quebec is a province. For the next three years Canadians received a crash course in federalism, constitutional law, and the amending formula. As the clock ticked down and the pressure increased, English Canadians were told to pass Meech or lose Quebec, that the distinct society clause was the price of Canada. But was it? Many thoughtful people didn’t think so.

And they objected to the process, to eleven men in suits cutting a deal behind closed doors. Indeed, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the premiers never understood that the Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms didn’t belong to them. It belonged to Canadians and its promise of equality rights couldn’t be rewritten without their meaningful participation and consent.

Clyde Wells had been consistent in his opposition to Meech, which had been negotiated by his predecessor. A rocky outcrop of unrequited dreams on the absolute edge of North America, Newfoundland required a strong federal government, Wells argued. But Meech Lake threatened to weaken Ottawa, he said, because of the limits it placed on the federal spending power, or its power to spend money in provincial jurisdictions like health and social welfare, as well as in the field of regional economic development. It was a curious inversion of Newfoundland nationalism: committed to Newfoundland’s survival, Wells stood up for Canada in order to stand up for Newfoundland.

Now, Canadians were being asked to write a blank cheque to Quebec in the form of the distinct society clause. For Indigenous peoples, it was too much, especially since the Accord failed to include them in its definition of Canada: ‘French-speaking Canadians, centred in Quebec but also present elsewhere in Canada, and English-speaking Canadians, concentrated outside Quebec but also present in Quebec’, constitute, according to the Accord, ‘a fundamental characteristic of Canada’. In jest, some Indigenous peoples even adopted Meech as a verb, as in, ‘I’ve been meeched’, or ‘I’ve been screwed.’ On behalf of his people, Elijah Harper did not intend to be meeched: Quebec is distinct, he said, but so too are First Nations.

In 1995 Quebec held a second referendum on sovereignty, again with the promise of some kind of economic association with Canada. The polls said that it would be close. On the night of 30 October, Canadians gathered in living rooms, bars, and restaurants to watch the returns, not knowing how Quebec would vote or what a yes vote might mean. Was Ottawa legally obligated to negotiate with Quebec after a yes vote? If it refused, would Quebec issue a unilateral declaration of independence? And if it did, would the world recognize Quebec as a new and independent nation-state?

In the end, it didn’t matter: Quebec voted 50.6 per cent no and 49.4 per cent yes. A near-death experience, Canada had escaped a constitutional crisis by less than 55,000 votes. The premier of Quebec blamed money and the ethnic vote.

The 1995 referendum, moreover, threatened not just the break-up of Canada but the break-up, or partition, of Quebec. Insisting that it had a right to national self-determination, the Grand Council of the Crees held its own referendum, asking the Cree people in northern Quebec if they wished to remain in Canada: 96 per cent said yes, suggesting that Quebec, at the very moment of its independence, would have confronted its own separatist movement. After all, if Canada is divisible, so too is Quebec.

Meech Lake, Charlottetown, and the second Quebec referendum ended what political scientists refer to as mega-constitutional negotiations. By definition protracted and divisive, they have not been restarted since 1995, ending a thirty-odd-year debate. While it is true that Quebec has not signed the constitution, it is also true that Quebec has built a modern, social-democratic welfare state in which citizens can live and work in French, guaranteeing the survival of the French language into the foreseeable future and making Quebec’s struggle to achieve its independence successful in everything but name. Its independence movement, which was part of a post-1945 worldwide movement to achieve national independence by former colonies, may be the world’s most successful independence movement. Certainly, it was the least violent.

As awareness highlights in your mind one incomplete task after another, you start to feel the burden of what you have to do. You question whether you will get it all done in the time frame that you’ve been given. A feeling of worry, nervousness, and unease about this uncertain outcome starts to set in. Anxiety has established its presence. The solution is to keep awareness on one project at a time. If it drifts away, bring it back. If you have an idea about Project B while working on Project A, write down that insight and return to working on Project A until you consciously choose to move awareness to another project.

That was uncomfortable and unpleasant, and something I desperately wanted to change. It was the understanding of awareness and the mind that paved the way to better managing my reactions and responses in life.

When I experience a situation or am treated a certain way, and I am unable to control where my awareness goes in my mind as a result, I create an uncontrolled response to that situation or treatment. Thus, I have a reaction.

You can teach them to communicate better. Breathe better. Adopt a better diet. Exercise their bodies. Practice better mental health habits. But have you realized that what they need to learn any of these skills well is their mind? It is at the heart of it all. It is the center of their lives. If they don’t understand how their mind works and they have not been trained in harnessing and focusing it, how do you expect them to use it to thoroughly learn and absorb all the skills you wish them to acquire?

There are many reasons for fatigue, but distraction is rarely recognized as one of them. But you can see now that when awareness is uncontrolled in the mind, energy is all over the place, being consumed unnecessarily in places where it does not need to be. And as energy levels drop, outcomes suffer.

Topics were brought up but never fully closed, meaning no conclusions were reached—not from a lack of information, but from the inability to stay on a topic and see it through to its end. This meant the same topic would need to be brought up again at a later time, everyone would have to be reengaged somehow, and a conclusion would need to be reached that would have been so much easier to get to while everyone was gathered in person at this meeting.

Every time awareness is distracted, it needs to disengage with what it was immersed in and then engage with the new thing that is calling for its attention. Once it’s done there, awareness needs to trace its way back, if it even can, to the area of the mind it was in before it got distracted. This constant engagement and disengagement is greatly time and energy consuming. Priceless continuity is broken. The potential for greater insights, solutions, and creativity is lost.

Interruptions are a form of distraction. Most companies attempt to deal with this by blocking out distractions in various ways. Building quiet rooms, silent areas, and the like is helpful, but this is a patch, not a cure. The cure is to teach people how to focus. If they know how to focus and can do it well, companies won’t have to figure out how to shield them from distractions so much.

Twenty-seven years ago, my guru shared with me the profound insight into the understanding of the inner workings of the mind. These time-tested teachings have been passed down for more than two millennia through monks of the spiritual lineage that he and I belong to. The ones who have realized the depths of these teachings—the simplicity of them, the practicality of them, the ability of them to bring profound states of realization if they are understood and applied in one’s life—those are the ones whose lives are never the same again. I am one of those people. I am one of those whose life has been transformed and so deeply impacted by these teachings. How could I not share this with you?

These teachings, as profound as they may be, are completely useless if they are not understood and consistently and correctly applied in your life. The burden of responsibility is on you and you alone.

Maintenant, je suis mon cadavre, un mort au fond d’un puits.

Mais lui, cette méprisable ordure, pour bien s’assurer qu’il m’avait achevé, il a guetté ma respiration, surveillé mes dernières palpitations, puis il m’a donné un coup de pied dans les côtes, et ensuite porté jusqu’à un puits, pour me précipiter par-dessus la margelle. Ma tête, déjà brisée à coups de pierre, s’est fracassée en tombant dans le puits ; mon visage et mon front, mes joues se sont écrasés, effacés ; mes os se sont brisés, ma bouche s’est remplie de sang.

Chez les Infidèles d’Occident, tous les chiens ont un maître. Les malheureux sont enchaînés par le col comme les plus vils esclaves, et on les traîne en spectacle dans les rues, tout seuls, un par un. Ces gens forcent même les pauvres bêtes à pénétrer dans les maisons, et les portent avec eux jusque dedans leur lit. Pas question pour deux chiens de se laisser aller aux petites privautés du reniflage, et encore moins de se monter dessus. Quand ils se croisent dans la rue, en laisse, c’est bien le maximum si, dans leur état pitoyable, ils peuvent échanger quelque œillade de chien battu. Que, ici à Istanbul, notre troupe s’ébatte librement en petites assemblées, barre les rues en menaçant qui bon lui semble, ou que chacun de nous aille se rouler à son aise dans un coin plus ensoleillé, ou se couche à l’ombre pour dormir comme un bienheureux, et fasse sa crotte où il veut, et morde qui il veut, sont des choses du dernier étrange pour ces horribles Infidèles.

But there’s no shortcut to forgiveness. The cost of forgiving the past before you’ve really confronted it is that you blame yourself for everything that happened to you. You can’t move an inch toward what you really want when you’re beating up on yourself.

If you really think about it, you’ll probably find the problem has been there a long time—which means the seeds were planted in childhood. How can our families harm us when they love us? Very easily, unfortunately. Most of us overlook one important fact when we think love is enough: Love and respect aren’t the same thing.

Love is fusion. As a baby, you belong to your parents, you’re an extension of them; and fusion is good for the survival of infants. Respect is differentiation: you belong to yourself, and you’re an extension of no one. Differentiation is essential for the happiness of adults.

Parents have their own dreams—and it’s those dreams they’re pushing, not yours. In their heads, they have images of successful sons and beautiful wealthy daughters, children who are impressive—and secure. Very few parents have the luxury, the calmness of spirit, to realize that the most practical thing any child can do is to find its own vision—and follow it.

Most inaction isn’t solely because of indecision—it’s because of fear. But every time you want to do something that scares you, and you dare to do it, your self-esteem goes up a few degrees. When you’re fearful but you step forward anyway, you do yourself a great service.

They couldn’t afford to wait until they had somehow built a good enough self-image to develop skills and find jobs, so we did what we called “acting as if.” Dress as if you respect yourself, whether you do or not, we told them.

I believe in planning, but the truth is that planning is mostly science fiction. There never was a plan that was more than a hopeful prediction. Even business plans are tall tales: “With this new color we expect to sell 50,000 items next year, 150,000 the year after next, and 500,000 the year after that.

’M CONVINCED that if you don’t know what you want, something is stopping you from knowing it. Something—a hidden resistance—is making you hesitate to find your true desire and go after it.

I would like you to find that resistance so you can figure out how to melt it. I know one simple, surefire way to make your resistance come out into the open: Start moving toward a goal you really want and the resistance will leap out of hiding and start trying to talk you out of moving. Your resistance will show up and try to convince you that the obstacles to your goal are insurmountable.

I’ve already given you four good reasons to swing into action as soon as possible: 1) it helps you think, 2) it puts a shine on your self-image, 3) it invites good luck in the form of information or opportunities, and 4) it sharpens your instincts. Well, here’s the fifth and most important reason: If you can make yourself go after a goal when you’re feeling stuck, you will activate—and expose—all the resistance that is causing you to be stuck.

Your resistance will stay dormant as long as you’re not threatening it. But it will wake up fast the second you start moving, and announce itself loudly: “What are you doing!?” “You’re going to get in trouble.” “This isn’t for you.” “This is a stupid idea.” “You’re going to fail.”

How do I know a resistance is blocking your desire? Because being stuck doesn’t make any sense. Logically, you know you could make a career choice, and if it wasn’t perfect, you could change it. That’s the way most people think. So what’s the big deal? Why can’t you get moving? Obviously there’s some big deal, or you wouldn’t have stayed in this uncomfortable spot for so long.

The only reasonable conclusion I can draw is that you sense some kind of danger in your path. Your resistance is trying to protect you from that danger. Take a look at an animal who won’t move and you’ll get an unmistakable message: There’s trouble up ahead. Animals don’t necessarily have the best information or the most perfect judgment, but they always have a compelling reason for standing perfectly still. The same is true for us.

Mais c’est quand même difficile de s’habituer à la condition d’assassin... Je ne supporte pas de rester chez moi. Et quand je sors, je ne supporte pas de rester dans ma rue, je passe de l’une à l’autre, il faut que je change de place tout le temps ; quand je dévisage les passants, j’aperçois bien que beaucoup se croient innocents, pour la seule raison que l’occasion de commettre un crime ne s’est pas encore présentée. Pourtant, il est difficile de croire que ce simple petit basculement de la chance ou du Destin m’ôte, à moi seul, la bonté et le sens moral échus à la plupart des gens. Tout au plus le fait de ne pas avoir encore perpétré de crime leur donne-t-il un air un peu plus stupide, et, comme tous les stupides, ils ont l’air bien intentionnés. Il m’a suffi de quatre jours à déambuler dans les rues d’Istanbul pour comprendre que tous ceux dont les yeux reflètent une lueur d’intelligence, ou qui portent sur leur visage une ombre de leur âme, sont autant d’assassins en puissance. Seuls les idiots sont vraiment innocents.

L’avide Shîrûyé, que Nizâmî décrit « puant la convoitise comme un lion affamé », trouve le moyen de faire séquestrer son père et de prendre sa place. Une nuit, il entre dans la chambre où celui-ci repose auprès de Shirine, trouve le lit en tâtonnant dans l’obscurité, et transperce les entrailles de son père avec son poignard. Ce dernier, jusqu’à l’aube, répand son sang dans le lit nuptial, et finit par mourir, près de la belle Shirine qui dort paisiblement.

J’ai donc passé trois jours à dessiner, sur le modèle des grands maîtres anciens, des centaines de chevaux, afin de comprendre ce que signifiait un cheval “qui vienne de moi”. » J’ai fini par lui montrer une série de chevaux tracés au crayon, comme exercice, sur une feuille de lourd papier de Samarcande. Il a pris la feuille avec intérêt et s’est mis à l’examiner aux rayons de la lune, en l’approchant de ses yeux. Je lui ai rappelé ce qu’affirmaient les anciens maîtres de Shîrâz et Hérat : que pour être à même de dessiner un cheval tel qu’il est vu par le regard de Dieu, il faut passer cinquante ans à dessiner des chevaux, et qu’en outre le meilleur dessin de cheval doit pouvoir être exécuté dans l’obscurité complète, car le maître authentique, au bout de cinquante ans, est tout à fait aveugle, et sa main dessine toute seule.

Will you save the world from destruction or create an illuminating work of art? Or do you have to make millions of dollars? I’m not making fun of you; I’m absolutely serious. Inside most of us is the feeling that truly meaningful work has to be on a giant scale, or has to lead to a kind of worldly “greatness,” like an Olympic medal.

Je dois donc la partie ensoleillée, joyeuse, créatrice de ma formation à cet amour pour Shékuré, tandis que la partie sombre m’est venue ensuite, une fois rejeté : mon désir infatigable, toujours renaissant, comme les flammes des braseros au milieu des nuits glaciales passées dans des auberges ; mes noires songeries, après l’amour, à côté d’une femme avec qui je venais de me rouler dans l’abîme, et ma déréliction.

Le shah d’Iran Tahmasp, le plus grand à la fois des ennemis de notre Empire et des rois amateurs de peinture, commença, voilà quarante ans, à devenir sénile, et sa passion pour les plaisirs, le vin, la musique, la poésie et la peinture se refroidit. Finalement, quand il en vint à arrêter le café, sa tête s’arrêta de fonctionner : assombri par ses lubies, le visage austère, il transporta sa capitale de Tabriz, qui était alors encore persane, à Qazvîn : afin, disait-il, d’être plus loin de l’armée ottomane. Prenant encore de l’âge, il fut un jour la proie d’un djinn. À la suite de cette crise, il renia d’un coup le vin, les jeunes garçons et la peinture, ce qui est bien la preuve que ce grand roi, en perdant le goût du café, avait aussi perdu l’esprit.

Mais, par miracle, l’histoire du livre d’Ibrahîm Mirzâ ne se finit pas là, car son bibliothécaire, un esthète à part entière, monta sur son cheval et entreprit, pour retrouver le meilleur artisan doreur, de se rendre à Shîrâz ; ensuite de porter à Ispahan deux pages pour le copiste dont la graphie persane était reconnue pour la plus délicate ; puis, passant les montagnes et jusque chez le Khan des Ouzbeks à Bukhârâ, il y fit établir, par le grand maître qu’il y retrouva, la composition, puis peindre les personnages ; redescendant à Hérat, il fit spécialement peindre, cette fois par un maître de l’ancienne école à moitié aveugle, les friselis contournés des feuillages et des pelouses ; et toujours à Hérat, il fit tracer à l’or, en écriture gracile, l’inscription du cadre au-dessus du dessin. Revenu à Kaïn, il présenta les quelques pages à moitié achevées, fruits d’un voyage de six mois, et reçut les félicitations du sultan déchu Ibrahîm Mirzâ. On comprit toutefois qu’à ce rythme le livre ne serait jamais fini, et l’on embaucha des messagers tatars. Chacun d’eux se voyait confier, avec les pages à compléter, une missive à remettre à l’artiste, décrivant le travail demandé. C’est ainsi que les messagers, traversant tout le pays d’Iran, le Khurâsân, et passant par le royaume des Ouzbeks jusqu’aux routes caravanières de la lointaine Transoxiane, emportèrent les pages du livre. Celui-ci, maintenant, progressait à la vitesse des chevaux. Parfois, par une nuit d’hiver, dans une auberge où l’on entendait hurler les loups, la cinquante-neuvième page rencontrait la cent soixantième, et, faisant connaissance, on se rendait compte qu’on travaillait pour le même ouvrage, on allait chercher dans la chambre les pages, pour tâcher de comprendre, en les comparant, dans quelle histoire elles allaient, à quelle épopée elles se rapportaient.

Indeed, the rights revolution that swept across much of the post-1945 world also swept across Canada, changing it irrevocably and making it a more just society. Everyone, it seemed, understood that they had rights and that they could claim them, in the streets if necessary, and through the courts when warranted. French Canadians, women, gays and lesbians, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, and organized labour variously embraced the language of rights and, after 1982, used the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to advance equality.

In many ways, language politics are Canadian politics. And, as often as not, the politics of language have been the politics of schools. In 1838, for example, on the heels of the rebellions in Lower and Upper Canada, Great Britain dispatched Lord Durham to investigate the crisis and he, in turn, dispatched an assistant to investigate the state of education in Lower Canada. Sharing Durham’s belief that French Canadians should be assimilated, Arthur Buller remarked that education could be an easy and powerful instrument of ‘Anglification’: no French schools, no French people. Neither British North America nor Canada ever wielded this blunt instrument, but that didn’t mean the schools question was settled

In the late 19th century and across much of the 20th century, in New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Ontario, French-language education rights were ignored by hostile provincial governments, unsympathetic courts, and a cautious federal government anxious to respect provincial autonomy, education being a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act.

The question of French-language education rights became urgent in the 1960s and 1970s when Quebec, the geographic, demographic, and political centre of French Canada, stopped seeing itself as part of French Canada and started seeing itself as the nation of Quebec. In effect, the birth of modern Quebec led to the death of French Canada, an irony not lost on French Canadians.

In 1968 the McGill University Student Union published a Birth Control Handbook. Printed on newsprint and bound with staples, it was ordered by student groups across the country, from Dalhousie University in Halifax to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. Distributed free of charge, supply never kept up with demand. And because it addressed both contraception and abortion, the Handbook spoke to the growing movement to legalize abortion.

Eventually, the Supreme Court entered the fray. And in 1988 it released one of its most important decisions when it ruled that Canada’s abortion law violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically section 7 guaranteeing everyone ‘the right to life, liberty and security of the person’. Justice Bertha Wilson, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, argued that the right to liberty included reproductive rights: ‘the right to reproduce or not to reproduce’, she wrote, is integral to ‘modern woman’s struggle to assert her dignity and worth as a human being’.

Before the late 1960s and early 1970s, gays and lesbians lived in the closet, unable to come out because of the enormous personal and professional costs, to say nothing of the physical risks. Of course, they had created spaces of their own where they could drink, dance, and cruise, in cafés, bars, and parks, in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver. But the fear of being outed was real, especially after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police launched a witch hunt in the late 1950s. Convinced that gays and lesbians employed in the military, the federal civil service, and in its own ranks constituted a Cold War security risk because they could be blackmailed by Soviet operatives, the RCMP began a gay hunt and, by the late 1960s, it had opened 8,000 files on known or suspected homosexuals, almost always men. No evidence of Soviet blackmail was ever uncovered, although careers were ended and lives were ruined. And in what historians describe as a grotesque farce, the federal government even funded the development of the fruit machine, a device that researchers believed could detect homosexuality through the measurement of pupil dilation in men who had been shown homo- and heteroerotic images. Although the fruit machine was cancelled in 1967, the gay purge in the RCMP, the military, and the civil service continued into the 1990s and included women as well as men.

Of course, it’s not one thing, it’s several: gender, religion, difference, identity, tradition, modernity, and belonging. Ultimately, however, they are talking about the nation, and that conversation can be hard. Nations are real, bound by borders and held together by laws.

On the one hand, section 35 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is clear: ‘The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.’ On the other hand, section 35 is not at all clear because there is no consensus on what constitutes existing aboriginal and treaty rights, including existing aboriginal and treaty rights to hunt and fish. In short, who controls the hunt? Although the question dates to the late 18th century, there was, and is, no simple answer.

If a success story because the agreements brought First Nations into the commercial fishery, it is also a cautionary tale because those agreements also defined, and therefore limited, the treaty right to earn a moderate livelihood by Mi’kmaq and Maliseet peoples. In other words, direct access to the fishery by Indigenous peoples for themselves, their families, and their communities became heavily regulated access to the fishery by a handful of licence holders and their crews. Who controls the hunt, or in this case the fishery? The Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the First Nations, but not, ironically, Indigenous peoples.

In addition to recognizing and affirming existing Aboriginal and treaty rights, section 35, subsection 2, defines Aboriginal peoples as ‘the Indian, Inuit, and Metis Peoples of Canada’. It was an enormous political and legal victory for the Metis, historically the most vulnerable of Canada’s Indigenous peoples because they did not sign treaties and because they were not—and still are not—governed by the Indian Act.

In 1993 Steve Powley and his son Roddy Powley shot and killed a bull moose near Sault Ste Marie in northern Ontario but were promptly charged by a conservation officer for hunting without a licence under Ontario’s Game and Fish Act. However, the Powleys insisted that they had an existing Aboriginal right to hunt for food as Metis people. To make his point, Steve Powley had attached a handwritten tag to the ear of the moose indicating that he was Metis and that it was to provide meat for the winter.

But in 2003 the Supreme Court ruled that the Powleys had an existing Aboriginal treaty right to hunt for food. It also ruled that the right to hunt for food was not a blanket right, covering the country from one end to the other, but a site-specific right, applying, in this instance, to the Metis community in and around Sault Ste Marie.

Je me suis mis à regarder mon vieux dessin, de Shirine qui tombe amoureuse de Khosrow en voyant son portrait accroché à la branche d’un arbre. Je m’étais inspiré à l’époque d’un modèle pris dans un volume de qualité médiocre, récemment rapporté de Tabriz, qui se trouvait chez mon Oncle. Ce dessin, contrairement au souvenir qu’il m’avait laissé tout au long de ces années, et comme il était naturel vu la naïveté du trait et de la déclaration d’amour en question, ne me faisait plus honte ; mais il n’éveillait pas non plus le souvenir d’une jeunesse heureuse.

Certains grands maîtres qui n’ont pas encore renoncé au métier, vendent des dessins à l’unité, sans rapport avec une histoire ou un livre. Quand on regarde ces dessins isolés, on est incapable de dire de quelle scène il s’agit, de quelle histoire. On apprécie et on paye le peintre pour, comme ils disent, la beauté du sujet, par exemple pour un cheval, juste pour le plaisir de contempler et de dire : “Que c’est beau, un cheval parfait !” Les images de guerre ou pornographiques sont très demandées. À côté de cela une grande scène de bataille ne dépasse pas trois cents écus, et d’ailleurs personne n’en commande.

The efforts by organized labour to secure its rights are historical, stretching back to the second half of the 19th century and the rise of industrial capitalism. From the 1850s to the 1930s there were over 5,000 strikes, walkouts, and riots, one leading to the next. Some ended in modest gains, others in lasting defeat, but labour never threw in the towel, insisting on higher wages, shorter hours, better working conditions, and collective bargaining rights. Bread and butter issues also competed with talk of revolution and dreams of what might be: in labour halls and beer parlours across the country, radical alternatives to the prevailing economic and political order were debated into the morning light.

Undaunted, organized labour continued its struggle to ease a burden of poverty made worse by the crisis of capitalism in the 1930s, when the unemployment rate reached 30 per cent, when women stretched food budgets, took in boarders, and looked to cleaning, sewing, and, in some instances, prostitution as sources of informal but paid work, when children turned to stealing food, wood, and coal to supplement the family economy, and when a desperate federal government created a string of remote work camps across the country that housed 170,000 unemployed men.

And from 1945 to the 1970s, Canada witnessed a Fordist compromise between the state, capital, and labour. Named after industrialist Henry Ford, and marked by mass production, mass consumption, and the legal recognition of unions, Fordism ushered in an era of economic growth and relative labour peace: in return for higher wages, job security, and pension plans, a depoliticized labour movement stopped dreaming of what might be and became instead a partner in the economic and political order. But the economic shocks of the 1970s and 1980s and the declining rate of profitability saw the eclipse of Fordism and the rise of neo-liberalism, a much-used, if not always understood, word. An ideological commitment to markets over people on the assumption that what is good for markets must be good for people, neo-liberalism is also a set of business and management practices, for example, outsourcing, subcontracting, and precarious work, or work that is non-unionized, poorly paid, unskilled, and insecure. As well, neo-liberalism is a rewriting of the social contract between governments and citizens that sees governments of all political stripes preach austerity, roll back the welfare state, peg the minimum wage below the poverty line, reduce welfare benefits, restrict public health insurance plans, and make it more difficult to access unemployment insurance and to qualify for workers’ compensation.

At 8,891 kilometres, it’s the world’s longest undefended border, a fact taught in every elementary school in the country. Meanwhile, Canadian politicians routinely invoke it as a symbol both of mutual friendship and of Canada’s sovereignty because they know that the Canadian–American border is also psychological, that it exists in the national imagination, especially the English Canadian imagination, and that this border, the psychological border, must be defended. Speaking to an American audience in 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau therefore asserted Canada’s sovereignty when he referred to the undefended border. He then added, in a now famous quip, that living next to the United States is like sleeping with an elephant: no matter how even-tempered the beast is, ‘one is affected by every twitch and grunt’.

Canada’s relationship with the United States dates to the late 18th century when British North America had to learn, sometimes the hard way, how to share a continent with a rarely easy, often difficult, and sometimes truculent republic that believed God and nature had ordained that it would span the entire continent. Disputes, border raids, and even war punctuated the early relationship. Although the War of 1812 lasted just two years, it saw the Americans, the British, and the Canadian militia fight a series of battles at sea and on land. In 1813 the Americans attacked York, now Toronto, looting homes, setting fires, and, as a trophy of war, taking the wooden mace, a symbol of the Crown’s sovereignty, from the Legislative Assembly. A year later, the British attacked Washington in retaliation, setting fire to government buildings, including the White House, and forcing the American leadership to flee. In the end, both sides claimed victory: the United States had won its claim to the territories west of Ohio while British North America had repelled an American invasion.

Why let facts get in the way of a good story, in this case a national story? Calling it Canada’s war of independence, writers, journalists, and politicians have turned General Brock, Laura Secord, and Tecumseh into national heroes and usable symbols of patriotism and loyalty. Yet Brock was a British officer defending British interests, not a proto-Canadian. Secord may have undertaken a dangerous 30-kilometre journey across the Niagara frontier, in what is today southern Ontario, to warn the British of an American attack, but she did not turn the tide, let alone save the country. And Tecumseh, the great Shawnee chief, did not care about the fate of British North America but he did care deeply about the fate of Indigenous peoples in the Ohio Valley when he fought with the British against the Americans. Two hundred years later, in 2012, Canadians marked the war’s bicentennial with earnest speeches, commemorative coins, and re-enactments while Brock, Secord, and Tecumseh were given a new shine: they fought for Canada.

The United States may not have liked the idea of a hereditary monarchy on its northern border, but it was largely inoffensive and certainly not worth the price of invasion. According to one historian, the real lesson of the Canadian–American border is not how long it took to negotiate but how innovative the process had been: in agreeing to negotiation, in submitting to arbitration, and in avoiding war, the British, Americans, and Canadians made an important contribution to modern international relations.

But for the Plains Indigenous peoples, the border defied common sense, contradicted their experience, cut across their land, and denied their ancient patterns of use and occupation: the prairies couldn’t be cut in half. At least initially, the Indigenous peoples simply ignored the border. But for their own reasons, Canada and the United States began to exert control, restrict movement, enforce the law, and deport Indigenous peoples to one side or the other: actually, the prairies could be cut in half and by 1900 the border was largely, if not perfectly, secure.

Writer Thomas King captures the arbitrary reality and the different meanings of the 49th parallel in his short story ‘Borders’. When an Indigenous woman attempts to drive across the Alberta–Montana border to visit her daughter, the American border agent, swaying side to side like a cowboy, asks her citizenship. ‘Blackfoot’, she says. Turned back, she is asked the same question by the Canadian border agent and she gives the same answer. For the next few days, she and her son are stuck between the two sides, forced to sleep in their car in a borderland that had been negotiated well over 100 years earlier by men indifferent to Indigenous peoples and carved out of the prairies by yet other men armed with sledgehammers, stakes, and instruments for measuring angles and distances. And continuing the process of semiotic imperialism that began with Jacques Cartier in the 16th century, lakes and mountains were named after members of the survey teams, their Indigenous names replaced by Cameron Lake and Anderson Peak.

Moreover, simple economics—in this case, the economies of scale—meant that American factories could produce shirts, shoes, domestic wares, industrial parts, and everything else under the sun for less, driving down the cost per unit.

On the one hand, the National Policy worked: Canada’s manufacturing sector, located principally in central Canada, grew year over year and decade over decade. But, on the other hand, it led to branch plants: to get around Canada’s tariffs, American corporations opened subsidiaries, or branch plants, on the Canadian side of the border but kept their head offices on the American side. And tariff wall or no tariff wall, American capital developed Canada’s early mining, pulp and paper, and petroleum sectors. A stable democracy that sat on some of the world’s largest deposits of minerals, stands of timber, and reserves of oil, Canada was both a safe and profitable place for American capital. By 1914 one-quarter of American foreign direct investment was in Canada.

During the First World War and throughout the interwar years, Canada and the United States continued down the road of cooperation and integration, the continental pull of trade and finance exerting a quiet but powerful logic. But it wasn’t only the logic of continentalism that deepened Canada’s dependence on the United States. It was also Britain’s weakness. Because Great Britain did not have the capacity to lend money to Canada, it effectively forced its former colony into the arms of yet another former colony. The key date? July 1915. One historian has described it as a ‘critical’ month in Canadian history: at the very moment Prime Minister Borden was in London to attend a meeting of the British cabinet—a measure, surely, of Canada’s stature—his minister of finance was in New York—cap in hand—to negotiate a $45 million loan from J. P. Morgan & Co. London still mattered politically, but Wall Street had replaced the City as Canada’s key lender. Confirming its deepening relationship with the United States, Canada opened an embassy in Washington in 1926, at first calling it a ‘legation’ and its ambassador a ‘minister’ because Great Britain, until 1931, retained ultimate authority over Canada’s foreign affairs. But the point had been made: Ottawa would speak directly to Washington, not through London.

The Second World War saw a series of wartime agreements between Canada and the United States, including the Permanent Joint Board on Defence, an advisory board on North American defence established in 1940. Eighty years later it still convenes and still makes recommendations. In the equally important field of trade, a complicated agreement was reached in 1941 that all but erased the border for raw materials and component parts for munitions and equipment. For the duration of the war, it turned the continent into a cross-border munitions factory. There was a lot of handwringing about what this meant for Canadian sovereignty, but the argument was compelling: Canada and the United States may be two countries, but they are one continent with linked economies.

A macabre fifty-year nuclear standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Cold War drew Canada closer to the United States. Conscious that it was a junior partner, or an errand boy to critics of American leadership in the Cold War, Canada sought safety in numbers in the international arena. Multilateral organizations like the British Commonwealth of Nations (now the Commonwealth of Nations), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and especially the United Nations would provide Canada with opportunities to cultivate different alliances, to assume different roles in the world, and to offset the United States. Neither a superpower nor a minor power, Canada could be a middle power, that is, an honest broker and a helpful fixer on the world stage.

The first conflict of the Cold War—and therefore the first test of collective security—occurred on the Korean peninsula in 1950 when North Korea attacked South Korea. Suddenly, Canada found itself fighting a war in East Asia. Officially, it was a UN war. But unofficially, it was an American war. In all, 26,000 Canadians served in Korea: 516 were killed and another 1,200 were injured. When it ended in a stalemate in 1953, Canada withdrew its troops, leaving historians to debate the war’s meaning. To some, it indicated Canada’s willingness to follow the United States wherever it went. To others, it indicated Canada’s commitment to the principles of multilateralism and collective security. In fact, it was both: Canada did not have a lot of cards to play when its key ally was also the leader of what was then called the Free World, but it played its cards well in the corridors of power, establishing

The first conflict of the Cold War—and therefore the first test of collective security—occurred on the Korean peninsula in 1950 when North Korea attacked South Korea. Suddenly, Canada found itself fighting a war in East Asia. Officially, it was a UN war. But unofficially, it was an American war. In all, 26,000 Canadians served in Korea: 516 were killed and another 1,200 were injured. When it ended in a stalemate in 1953, Canada withdrew its troops, leaving historians to debate the war’s meaning. To some, it indicated Canada’s willingness to follow the United States wherever it went. To others, it indicated Canada’s commitment to the principles of multilateralism and collective security. In fact, it was both: Canada did not have a lot of cards to play when its key ally was also the leader of what was then called the Free World, but it played its cards well in the corridors of power, establishing a reputation for diplomacy at the United Nations.

That reputation served Canada in 1956 when Great Britain, with France and Israel, attacked Egypt in response to Egypt’s nationalization of the Suez Canal, a vital transportation link connecting Europe to the oil fields of the Middle East. An ill-thought military action by a fading empire, Britain’s reckless behaviour threatened to escalate into a much larger conflict involving the United States and the Soviet Union.

Although well versed in gunboat diplomacy, the Americans were not pleased and, like everyone else, desperately wanted a way out. Led by Lester B. Pearson, its extremely able secretary of state for external affairs, Canada crafted an exit strategy when it pushed the creation of a United Nations Emergency Force, or a peacekeeping force, that would occupy the canal zone, separate the belligerents, and give diplomats the space to find a peaceful solution. It was a remarkable moment: for a few weeks in the fall of 1956, Canada played the lead role in a global drama. A year later, Pearson received the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Suez Crisis and Pearson’s leadership ushered in a new era in Canadian foreign policy: for the next four decades, Canada contributed to every UN peacekeeping mission, in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Incredibly, Canada still maintains a small number of peacekeepers in Cyprus as part of a UN operation that began in 1964. Because it fit with Canada’s self-understanding as a middle power, peacekeeping even became part of the Canadian identity, distinguishing Canada from the United States and reinforcing the psychological border: Americans make war, but Canadians make peace

Celebrated in books and sanctified in an Ottawa monument, peacekeeping is now a national symbol.

Canada’s dedication to peacekeeping isn’t rhetorical. But nor is it the whole story. Across the length of the Cold War, Canada’s obligation to NATO was much larger both in terms of service men and women on the ground and in terms of the percentage of the defence budget it consumed. And among countries contributing to UN peacekeeping missions in 2019, Canada ranked fifty-ninth, behind France, Spain, and Germany, but ahead of the United States.

Canada’s historical and ongoing service to the UN has been likened to a national religion, but its faith in multilateralism did not change the fact that its primary foreign relationship was bilateral, not multilateral. And that relationship continued to deepen in the 1950s and 1960s. Built in the mid-1950s to warn of a Soviet attack across Canadian airspace, a series of shared radar lines—the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line, and the Distant Early Warning Line, or DEW Line—stretched west to east across Alaska and Canada. In 1957 Canada and the United States launched NORAD, the North American Air (now Aerospace) Defence Command, a fully integrated continental air defence command headquartered in Colorado and led by an American commander and a Canadian deputy.

Things came to a head during the 1962–3 Bomarc missile crisis. Placed in silos in North Bay, Ontario, and La Macaza, Quebec, as part of a NORAD agreement, Bomarc missiles were American-made anti-aircraft missiles that were effective only with nuclear warheads. The Canadian government had agreed but then equivocated. At one point, the missiles were loaded with sand bags. The Americans were furious. In the end, it took a general election and a new prime minister to resolve the crisis, but in 1963 Lester Pearson agreed to house nuclear weapons on Canadian soil under the ultimate authority of NORAD. To his critics, the irony was too much: hadn’t Pearson won the Nobel Peace Prize just a few years earlier?

La vérité, en effet, c’est que ni la soif maudite de l’or ni même l’appétit de gloire ne sauraient corrompre l’art authentique et le réel talent. La vérité, s’il faut la dire tout haut, c’est que la fortune et la gloire sont l’apanage mérité des grands artistes, tels que moi, et que c’est là ce qui nous motive. Mais si je criais cela sur les toits, mes collègues, qui crèvent tous de rage et d’envie, me sommeraient de rendre des comptes ; alors, pour démontrer que j’ai plus de conscience professionnelle, il me faudrait, pour pensum, peindre un arbre sur un grain de riz. Je suis persuadé que cette passion du « style » et pour les « signatures » est une importation d’Orient, et même, en fait, de l’Occident, par l’intermédiaire de certains maîtres chinois enténébrés par l’influence des Européens, et de leurs images, cette contrebande des jésuites

Il était une fois un jeune Khan mongol dans sa forteresse des montagnes, au nord de l’Hindû-Kûsh, passionné de peinture et de dessin. Parmi les femmes de son harem, il n’en aimait qu’une seule, mais à la folie, et celle-ci, jeune Tatare, belle parmi les belles, était aussi éperduement amoureuse de lui. À longueur de nuit, et jusqu’aux petites heures du matin, ils s’adonnaient, à perdre haleine, à de si brûlants ébats, se délectaient d’un tel bonheur qu’ils auraient voulu que cette vie inimitable fût aussi éternelle. Aussi bien avaient-ils découvert que la meilleure façon de réaliser ce souhait était de regarder pendant des heures, à longueur de journée, sans relâche, les merveilleuses et parfaites images de l’amour qu’ils trouvaient dans les livres des maîtres anciens. Et en effet, à force de contempler toujours les mêmes illustrations sans défauts des mêmes histoires d’amour, ils sentaient leur félicité égaler peu à peu celle de ces récits des temps heureux de l’Âge d’Or

Si mon fils ajoute sa signature, ne sera-t-il pas présomptueux, de sa part, de s’attribuer en propre les techniques et le style de ses maîtres anciens, qu’il ne fait qu’imiter ? Sans compter que, s’il signe, cela peut vouloir dire : “Ma peinture porte trace de mes insuffisances

Il écrivit son nom dans un coin du tableau, entre la pelouse et le mur, là où, s’imaginait-il, on ne remarquerait rien. Cette première miniature qu’il signa était une scène de Khosrow et Shirine ; vous savez : après leur mariage, Shîrûyé, fils de Khosrow d’un premier lit, tombe amoureux de la belle Shirine ; et une nuit, s’étant glissé dans leur chambre par la fenêtre, il plonge son poignard dans le foie de son père, couché auprès de Shirine endormie. En contemplant l’œuvre de son fils, le vieux Padishah se rend compte que quelque chose ne va pas. C’est qu’il a vu la signature, mais comme il arrive souvent, quand nous ne percevons pas clairement un détail ; de même, il pensa seulement : « Il y a une faute dans cette miniature. » Car ce n’était plus une image que les maîtres anciens auraient pu avoir peinte, et le Padishah fut pris d’un doute affreux. Le livre qu’il contemplait ne rapportait plus une histoire, une légende, mais quelque chose d’absolument inadmissible dans un livre : une réalité. Et au moment où il comprend, le vieil homme a une vision d’horreur : son fils, son illustrateur, vient d’entrer par la fenêtre, comme dans sa propre miniature, et sans même affronter les yeux exorbités du père, lui enfonce, comme dans le tableau, un poignard énorme dans le cœur.

Car s’il est vrai que ce peintre n’avait pas signé de son nom, il avait introduit, dans son œuvre superbe, un très habile défaut, au niveau des naseaux du cheval, qui lui permettait de se distinguer. Le Shah déclara que le style est un rejeton de l’erreur, et il exila ce peintre à Byzance

Ce défaut caché, ajouté au tableau, était un signe de reconnaissance, un secret partagé par les seuls amants. Papa, j’ai regardé toute la journée cette image d’une belle jeune fille à cheval, et il n’y a pas la moindre trace de moi ! Ce peintre est sûrement un grand maître, et de surcroît un beau jeune homme, mais il n’est pas amoureux de moi.

Le premier conte veut montrer que le “style” n’est qu’une erreur, ai-je poursuivi. Ensuite, le deuxième conte démontre qu’une peinture parfaite n’a pas besoin de signature. Finalement, le troisième conte démontre conjointement les deux idées que signature et style n’expriment qu’un ridicule et naïf orgueil de ses propres défauts.

Puis il m’a interrogé sur la compatibilité entre le mariage et l’exercice de mon art. À vrai dire je travaille beaucoup et j’aime mon travail. Et je viens d’épouser la plus belle fille du quartier. À tout moment, quand je ne peins pas, nous faisons l’amour comme des fous. Puis je me remets au travail. Mais ce n’est pas ce que je lui ai dit. « C’est une grave question, ai-je répondu. Si le pinceau d’un peintre engendre des chefs-d’œuvre, il fera, du côté de sa femme, une piètre besogne ; et à l’inverse, s’il est bien dru et sait ravir les sens d’une charmante épouse, son pinceau et son art restent tout desséchés. » Évidemment, Le Noir a cru ces belles paroles, à l’instar de tous ces gens qui, comme lui, sont envieux des peintres.

Le Noir était en train d’admirer la double page que j’étais sur le point de finir, pour le Livre des Réjouissances, et je m’étais assis, à côté de lui, sur le coussin rouge où ma jolie femme, peu de temps auparavant, avait pressé elle-même la chaleur de son entrecuisse, pendant que mon calame s’affairait à bien faire sentir les tourments des prisonniers devant notre Sultan, en s’affairant elle-même avec dextérité sur mon autre roseau...

Pour bien mettre en valeur le malheur, l’infamie, et quelle délivrance était opérée par l’acte magnanime, à côté du dernier condamné, j’avais eu l’idée, non préméditée, de faire figurer sa femme, la mine défaite, décomposée, dans une robe pourpre et souillée, à côté de leur fille aux longs cheveux lâchés, belle encore dans son chagrin, et drapée d’une étole écarlate.

Suivant l’exemple des copistes arabes, ceux-là mêmes qui croyaient naïvement à l’immortalité des livres et de la Tradition, qui avaient coutume, depuis cinq siècles, chaque matin à l’aube, de fixer l’horizon pour prévenir la cécité — vers l’ouest, en tournant le dos au soleil levant —, le grand Ibn Shâkir était monté, dans la fraîcheur de l’aube, au minaret de la Grande Mosquée, et depuis le parapet, il avait pu contempler la fin de cinq cents ans de tradition et d’écritures. Il vit le premier les troupes sanguinaires du Grand Khan entrer dans la ville, et resta prudemment sur son minaret. De là-haut, il suivit les pillages et les destructions, les massacres en pagaille, l’assassinat, après cinq siècles de pouvoir, du dernier calife Abbasside, les femmes violées, l’incendie des bibliothèques, et les milliers de volumes jetés au Tigre. Deux jours plus tard, il vit, parmi l’infection des cadavres et les cris des agonisants, que l’eau du fleuve virait au rouge, de l’encre diluée des livres, de ses livres qu’il avait copiés lui-même, de sa belle main, et qui n’avaient servi à rien pour arrêter cet horrible carnage, toutes ces dévastations. Alors il jura de ne plus jamais écrire.
